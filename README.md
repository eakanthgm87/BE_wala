# 🤖 AI Command Terminal

An **AI-powered developer terminal** that converts **natural language instructions into safe executable system commands**.

Instead of remembering complex terminal commands, you can simply type:

```
ai: find all python files
ai: delete temporary files
ai: explain docker
```

The AI understands your intent, generates the correct command, checks for safety, and executes it.

# 🚀 Features

## 🧠 Natural Language Commands

Write commands in **plain English** and the AI converts them into terminal commands.

Example:

User Input

```
ai: list all python files
```

Generated Command

```
find . -name "*.py"
```

---

## 🛡 AI Safety Guard

The system automatically blocks **dangerous commands** like:

```
rm -rf /
shutdown
format disk
```

Risky commands require confirmation before execution.

---

## 👁 Command Preview System

Before running a command, the system displays:

• Generated command
• Risk level
• Execution confirmation

This prevents accidental destructive commands.

---

## 💬 AI Chat Mode

If the input is a **question instead of a command**, the system switches to **chat mode**.

Example:

```
ai: what is docker
ai: explain git branching
```

---

## ⚡ Self-Healing Terminal

If a command fails, the AI can:

1. Analyze the error
2. Suggest corrections
3. Retry with a fixed command
